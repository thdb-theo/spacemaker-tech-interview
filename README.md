## Installation

1. Clone the repository

3. Run `npm start`, and go to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Instructions

- Change proposals with the buttons in the left panel.
- Press the polygons in the map to interact with them. Pressing a selected polygon deselects it
- When two polygons are selected, you can merge them with either the union or the intersection button in the right panel
- The areas of both the whole proposal and the selected polygons are displayed in the right panel
- You cannot merge two disjoint polygons, nor do an intersection which results in disjoint polygons
